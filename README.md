# Programer: Nguyễn Thanh Tường

# This is an application I write to test my knowledge about Bridge Design Patterns. 
# FUNCTION: 
You can use this application to manage (adding, editing, deleting) City info, Customer info, Products, Employees, Bill and Detail of Bill...
# ABOUT BRIDGE: 
- It have an interface (BusinessLayer) to define all the function that each class in Business Layer use.
- One abstract class (AbstractManage) use to link the interface and the way we use functions in the interface.
- InfoHolder: Is the support class that I use it to store all the infomation that will be needed in the whole application (Product name, Custommer name, Employee name, ...)
# What I have learn
- I learn alot about Bridge Design Pattern
- I have know more about class management throught creation of InfoHolder class.

I was happy that I had complete this app, althought it just an example app to test my knowledge.
